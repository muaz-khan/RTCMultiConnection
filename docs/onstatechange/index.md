    <p>This event was used in RTCMultiConnection v2.2.2 and earlier.</p>
    <p>Because v2.2.2 is no more maintained. That's why documentation for this event is also removed.</p>
    <p>Please check these API instead: <a href="/docs/onUserStatusChanged/">onUserStatusChanged</a> or <a href="/docs/onPeerStateChanged/">onPeerStateChanged</a></p>
